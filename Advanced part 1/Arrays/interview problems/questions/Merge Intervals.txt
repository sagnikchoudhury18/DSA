Problem Description
You have a set of non-overlapping intervals. You are given a new interval [start, end], insert this new interval into the set of intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.



Problem Constraints
0 <= |intervals| <= 105



Input Format
First argument is the vector of intervals

second argument is the new interval to be merged



Output Format
Return the vector of intervals after merging



Example Input
Input 1:

Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 5] .
Input 2:

Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 6] .


Example Output
Output 1:

 [ [1, 5], [6, 9] ]
Output 2:

 [ [1, 9] ]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

(2,5) does not completely merge the given intervals
Explanation 2:

(2,6) completely merges the given intervals



Expected Output
Enter your input as per the following guideline:
There are 3 lines in the input

Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : An array of intervals. First number represents the number of intervals to follow. Then for every interval we get a pair of integers. 
	For example, Intervals: [(1, 3), (6, 9)] will be written as "2 1 3 6 9"(without quotes).

Line 2 & Line 3 ( Corresponds to arg 2 ) : New Interval represented by a pair of integers. 
	For example, Interval: (2, 5) will be written as "2 5"(without quotes)
