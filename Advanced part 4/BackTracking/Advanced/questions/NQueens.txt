Problem Description
The N-queens puzzle is the problem of placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer A denoting the value of N, return all distinct solutions to the N-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the N-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
The final list should be generated in such a way that the indices of the queens in each list should be in reverse lexicographical order.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 10



Input Format
First argument is an integer A denoting the size of chessboard



Output Format
Return an array consisting of all distinct solutions in which each element is a 2d char array representing a unique solution.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 4
Input 2:

A = 1


Example Output
Output 1:

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Output 1:

[
 [Q]
]
